## Introduction
*show-format, cancer, autoimmunity, estrogen, call-in*

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome back to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. Every month we have a guest speaker, and that guest speaker is the faithful, ever reliable, factual, informative Dr. Raymond Peat. This month is no exception.

Dr. Peat is joining us to discuss the continuing subject of cancer with reference to autoimmunity and estrogen. For those who wish to call in, we invite you to do so. It's a live show. We encourage questions related to the subject, but we also recognize there are instances where people are following protocols and have questions related to that protocol or indeed any other subject. Dr. Peat's a wealth of information, and outside of his area of expertise, he often has an answer for many different questions.

This month is a continuation of our broader discussion on cancer and alternative approaches to treatment. I've found some new research from 2019 and 2020 papers on immunotherapy, estrogen, and autoimmunity. If you'd like to call in, the number is 707-923-3911.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. For those people who perhaps might not have read anything you've written or heard you speak, would you explain your academic and professional background before we get into the show?

## Dr. Peat's Background and Academic Origins
*raymond-peat, scientific-method, reproductive-physiology, oxidative-metabolism, academic-bias*

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. When I graduated from college, that was in the humanities. I was an English major for a while, and then an art and psychology and philosophy major for a while, and worked for several years just in the humanities. But I was specializing in linguistics and wanted to understand how language works in the brain.

So I decided to study biology to better understand the brain so I could understand language as a basis for understanding the culture and humanities and so on. But when I got to graduate school at University of Oregon in 1968, I learned that the brain scientists were the most dogmatic. Well, the geneticists were more dogmatic. The brain science people were high status and very dogmatic.

So I looked around looking for people oriented towards science rather than dogmatism, and found that reproductive physiology people were actually doing research and not throwing away evidence that contradicted their basic ideas. So I specialized in the physiology of oxidative metabolism as it changes in the reproductive system with aging. And that happened to provide a good perspective on how to understand the brain and its energy. So it was useful for my original project.

And so then I wrote up *Mind and Tissue*, a little book about the history of people understanding brain metabolism in relation to psychology. And then for 10 or 20 years was specializing in the interactions of hormones and nutrition, counseling people on the effects of living and eating on your hormonal system and aging.

**Andrew Murray:** Something I picked up on there. You said that when you decided to follow up your undergraduate work, the reproductive physiology people were far less likely to throw away good information related to the research—therefore a little bit more careful in sticking to scientific principles and not burying it.

I want to ask you before we get into the subject matter: is this because the estrogen industry hadn't really gotten so much traction at that point? It was still in the early days of its push towards dominance. I guess it links to tonight's show because we're talking about estrogen and autoimmunity. Did you say that those reproductive physiology people weren't quite so inclined to throw this stuff away or have it mired with dogma?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. My brain nerve biology professor in class described doing some research, and he said, "And then you throw away the bad data in the lab." I would point out an instrument reading to him that was impossible by his ideas, and it just turned off his brain in a flash and he turned away. And I'm sure his memory was that he never saw that happen.

## Estrogen, Autoimmunity, and the AID Enzyme
*estrogen, autoimmunity, aid-enzyme, genetic-destabilization, cancer, holistic-medicine*

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the subject of tonight—estrogen, autoimmunity, and cancer. I want to read a paragraph from a 2021 article from PubMed. It said:

"Why women are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases is not completely clear, but new data suggests that the hormone estrogen may play an important role. A new study now shows that estrogen activates the expression of AID, which is activation-induced deaminase—a protein that drives antibody diversification by deaminating cytosine in DNA to uracil. If estrogen increases the level of AID, increased mutations could transform benign antibodies into self anti-self pariahs. And AID might also contribute to cancer, particularly in breast tissue which is highly responsive to estrogen, by introducing mutations and strand breaks into the genome."

I wanted to read that out because in our earlier conversation, Dr. Peat said he was looking more into autoimmunity and how estrogen unfavorably influences the immune system to basically become a self-destructive mechanism, or by knocking out things like nuclear factor kappa beta.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That article you cited is an extremely important landmark—not just in autoimmunity. One of the very earliest estrogen-cancer researchers, Leonel Strong, showed that estrogen destabilizes the whole genome. It promotes a tendency to develop an uneven number of chromosomes by losing or gaining an extra chromosome or piece of chromosome. So it's a genetic destabilizer.

And that's exactly what this article you cite does. It focuses on one single enzyme, which when it functions, helps to produce the essentially infinite variety of antibodies that we can make by creating an extreme rate of mutation locally. But that same destabilizing process works on many levels, all the way to the shape and function of the basic cell—not just that one mutation-promoting enzyme.

When you look at these landmarks, it's important to keep in mind: in between the big landmarks, like that article on the AID mutagenic enzyme, you have an almost continuous, seamless bunch of other changes that estrogen is acting on and producing that all tend in the same direction. The reductionist, mechanistic approach just can't look at that fact.

But wherever you look, probably thousands of different places are cooperating with that destabilizing effect on that one enzyme. Increasing the water content of the cell, for example, helps to destabilize the whole system. Hardening collagen, lowering oxygen tension, increasing nitric oxide production, histamine production—everywhere you look, it would take about an hour just to identify the main pro-inflammatory mechanisms that have been identified. But the interesting thing is it's holistic, almost seamlessly interacting—one factor supporting another factor.

**Andrew Murray:** I'm very pleased that you said that. I was so happy to find the article—I could hardly believe what I was reading. For the last 15 years, since I've been looking at articles to do shows and to bring to greater awareness people's understanding of how they're being duped by the system... I could hardly believe the article when I read it.

Along with that, there was another one, a 2019 publication—that one was a 2021 publication. I was like, wow, they're actually saying this. They're actually saying it the way it is. This is what you've been saying for a long, long time. I know we'll come back to that quip you've mentioned years ago: a lie gets around the world faster than truth can get its shoelaces tied.

But I was so heartened to see this article because researchers and scientists were actually disclosing this now. It's been buried and hidden for so long because the estrogen industry is so powerful. That's why I mentioned when you first started talking about your bio—the people in reproductive physiology perhaps weren't so keen to throw stuff away because they weren't as brainwashed. Probably because the estrogen industry hadn't got as much traction as it has now, both in Congress as well as in pharmaceutical frameworks. There's so much money behind it now that it's very easy to blind people to the truth and keep perpetuating the lie in an authoritarian fashion, which the medical system emphasizes and epitomizes completely.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've often wondered how my thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, came to be so open to the facts and resistant to the industry position. I think it was partly that he was born and educated before the power of the industry took over. And so he was aware of the research that was done in the 1930s—absolutely contradicting everything that since 1944 the estrogen industry has foisted on the public.

## Most Carcinogenic Foods
*pufa, carcinogens, dietary-factors, amino-acids, iron*

**Caller:** I have a question. What would you say are the top three most carcinogenic foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Probably polyunsaturated fat would be the worst.

**Caller:** And where's that found?

**Sarah Murray:** Liquid seed oil that is polyunsaturated. Olive oil is 90% monounsaturated, 10% polyunsaturated. Otherwise all the other seed oils are polyunsaturated.

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, for number one, how about number two?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would put the pro-inflammatory amino acids—tryptophan I would say was number two. Methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan.

**Andrew Murray:** And what are some foods with those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High quality proteins in excess.

**Andrew Murray:** Things like lots and lots of turkey?

**Sarah Murray:** So that's basically not more than 4 ounces of meat per day is what you have generally recommended for someone trying to avoid carcinogenic excess of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, definitely. You don't want to eat a pound or pound and a half of meat per day.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so PUFA, pro-inflammatory amino acids, particularly tryptophan. What else? Number three contender for cancerous foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure. Anything that contains a very great excess of iron I think should have a high spot.

**Andrew Murray:** And how does that relate to smoking a pack a day of cigarettes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How does it relate to what?

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, so how is, say, having a diet rich in PUFAs compared in cancer risk to smoking a pack a day of cigarettes—American cigarettes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, the PUFA is probably the biggest carcinogenic part of the American diet.

## Olive Oil, Whole Wheat Flour, and Chicken
*olive-oil, whole-grains, rancidity, chicken, pork, pufa*

**Caller:** Good evening. I'm calling from Garberville as well. I was curious—you answered my first question, which was about olive oil. I eat a lot of olive oil, which is unfiltered, which is fabulous stuff. So you've answered that question already, the mono.

So the second question was in relationship to our other caller who asked what the most carcinogenic foods were. Does whole wheat flour fall under that? And how about what is—are the constituents of chicken a healthy thing to eat? And I'll take my answer off. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

**Andrew Murray:** Whole wheat flour?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason flour and grains were polished—white rice, for example, and white flour—is that the whole grains get rancid and toxic fairly quickly in storage. And so if you're going to eat the whole wheat flour soon after it's ground, it's probably not so bad. But still, once it gets in your blood, those excess polyunsaturated fats are starting to react with iron in your blood to produce lipid peroxides and free radical toxins. The polished rice has very little nutritional value, but has at least a way to avoid the worse effects of storage toxins.

**Sarah Murray:** The rancidity is not going to go rancid—white rice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Very, very little rancidity.

**Sarah Murray:** So it prevents starvation because it doesn't have any other nutrients besides the carbohydrate calories.

**Andrew Murray:** Actually, I found myself sitting by an Asian American professor of nutrition and I asked him, you know, hippies eat brown rice—obviously that's best. Why isn't that done in Asia? And he said that was a storage issue because with white rice there's not enough nutrition that a weevil can't reproduce. But if they're eating whole grain meals or grains, then they're able to reproduce and you get an infestation instead of just losing a few grains.

**Sarah Murray:** Well, there's another reason.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, because it was stored. Everybody there ate tons of vegetables and some high quality meat. And so it wasn't an issue of fiber and vitamins. It was a storable, transportable food for armies and bureaucrats.

And the caller asked about chicken—your specific view on chicken too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On a typical industrial diet, chicken is full of very unstable polyunsaturated fats. And I think it in excess is pretty carcinogenic.

**Andrew Murray:** But if you had access to good, fresh, locally raised chicken from a free diet, no more than 4 ounces a day is okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. It's same with pork. Industrial pork has over 30% PUFA in the fat. And if people are careful what they feed their pigs, the fat goes down almost like beef—4% PUFA in the fat.

**Sarah Murray:** If you're not feeding them corn and all those PUFA-rich grains, then the fat of the chicken and the fat of the pork or the pig will be less full of those toxic polyunsaturated or PUFA oils. We call them PUFA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, like the traditional pig diet of whey and old vegetables.

## Gluten and Estrogen
*gluten, transglutaminase, estrogen, collagen, autoimmunity*

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, before you lose the train of thought—gluten and estrogen. I wanted to make sure that we got that connection.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, there's the enzyme transglutaminase is in common between gluten and, for example, the lining of the intestine acted upon by estrogen. And so if we have antibodies to the foreign protein gluten, they will act against our own tissues as far as they're under the influence of estrogen which induces the transglutaminase.

And the transglutaminase aspect of estrogen—it's the cross-linking enzyme that hardens collagen. And under the influence of estrogen producing transglutaminase, collagen itself becomes hardened and carcinogenic rather than flexible.

## Hemp Seeds and Pumpkin Seeds
*seeds, pufa, rancidity, dietary-recommendations*

**Caller:** Opinion on eating flax, sorry, hemp seed and pumpkin seed?

**Andrew Murray:** Hemp seed versus pumpkin seed, or either or both?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are not necessarily the worst for the PUFA, but I wouldn't say it's something that you should do regularly because of the breakdown products. They're probably fairly rancid by the time you ingest them anyway.

## Construction Materials and Bioestrogens
*environmental-estrogens, building-materials, pvc, chemical-exposure, housing*

**Caller:** I'm from Redway and I'm a construction worker, so I work with the typical construction materials—be they laminated glues, butyl, ABS glue. I cut ABS pipe all the time, and those I would assume are exuding the same kind of bioestrogens that you're referring to. And then there's also insulation.

I would really love to hear a program, if you don't mind me hijacking it for a second, to talk about the things that the general public are exposed to on a daily basis. I would love to hear about ABS and PVC—polyvinyl chloride—and how those chemicals react. I didn't listen to your show before this, but I would really love to know because I do work with them often.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you for your question. Dr. Peat, let's give it over to you first, and then just remind you that on our website we do run 85% of the shows that we've done. I still have a lot to put up from 2020 and 2021, unfortunately. It's some of the hottest stuff we've done actually on COVID. But Dr. Peat, the building materials—not just in California with their supposed safe regulations—but the glues and the PVCs and all of the sealants and solvents...

**Sarah Murray:** Christy's hot glue—I hate the smell of that stuff.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the safety law system, as far as it's existing, it's really part of a superstructure that enforces the use of the dangerous materials. They have laws to supposedly protect you against them, but the basic system is designed to direct production towards these cheapest and most dangerous chemicals.

In the long run, 10 years or more, I think the problem would be solved very economically instead of continuing the deforestation to make lumber and plywood and so on, and then support fire departments to put out houses that are burning down. Living in Mexico, I was interested that there are practically no fire departments because they're all mud and cement. And mud and cement are very cheap building materials. They pollute very little. You grind up some rocks, can make your house any shape you want. And it's chemically inert once it gets in place.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, you can burn seashells and make your own lime slate.

## Dietary Strategies to Protect Against Estrogen
*dietary-strategies, fiber, carrots, thyroid-function, calcium, vitamin-d, progesterone*

**Andrew Murray:** So what are some dietary strategies? If you've been working all day with these horrible chemicals, what should you eat and what should you do to get that stuff out of your body?

**Sarah Murray:** That's what I was just going to ask Dr. Peat in the last couple minutes of this show. Let's discuss some ways to help protect ourselves against the carcinogenic effects of estrogen. I know you've gone on about raw grated carrot and how effective they are at helping to decrease the endotoxin that we were talking about earlier. But also that they can actually absorb estrogen from the bowel.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any good fiber that isn't too poisonous—carrots have their own poisons, but the fiber keeps us from absorbing them. When it's raw carrot and moderately shredded, we absorb very little of the irritating or toxic chemicals.

But other fibers you might find more agreeable—anything from well-cooked mushrooms or bamboo shoots even to well-cooked bran. Oat bran, for example, has that fiber effect of getting the estrogen out of your intestine so it doesn't recycle and poison your liver. And so keeping the intestine as clean as possible means also keeping a rapid transit time and avoiding irritating foods that could cause inflammation and constipation.

And part of the effect is to watch that your thyroid isn't suppressed, because that will slow the elimination of estrogen. So keeping your metabolic rate up, keeping a temperature around 98.6 during the peak of the daytime—that will tend to give you a quick peristalsis and get things through your intestine before they have a chance to irritate and produce endotoxin and recycle estrogen.

**Sarah Murray:** And the other two supplements that are very helpful with keeping estrogen at bay—in our food, calcium is definitely one of them that helps to keep estrogen levels low. And vitamin D. Those are two other supplements that you can take, or you know, hopefully you're getting your calcium from dairy and green leafy vegetables.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And because they keep your metabolic rate higher the way thyroid does—the calcium, especially from low-fat milk supported by vitamin D—both are very good for weight loss.

**Sarah Murray:** And then lastly, one last thing is progesterone is a direct combat molecule to estrogen.

## Closing and Authoritarianism
*authoritarianism, freedom, health-sovereignty*

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, let's hold it there folks. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat. I'll just give out your information here. For those of you who've listened to the show, Dr. Raymond Peat—raypeat.com—plenty of articles to read, lots of science backing it.

Our website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com, we've got probably 12, 13, 14 years of archive shows. I've got all of the shows from 2020 and 2021 to go up. Unfortunately haven't done it, been very busy. But there are lots of COVID shows there to show how ridiculous this entire farce is.

I wanted just to finish up the show—we're going to discuss a little bit about authoritarianism. And I just this afternoon when I was getting the stuff together for the show, during the course of the afternoon here, came up with what I want to read out now. And it's just like a bit of a eulogy for you guys listening out there and for people for future prosperity.

But basically I called it "Authoritarianism and the Age of Acceptance: Have It All and Have Nothing."

We're evolving as a species, and with our evolution comes the concept of deranged acceptance. Nature is not accepting, but rather through evolutionary pressure it selects the fittest and is quite barbaric. It takes no prisoners and is quite merciless. Rules exist and nature obeys them, set from the foundation of the world, which we recently have also learned to meddle with and derange—like viruses and gain of function research and the origins of COVID.

The opposite perhaps of the all-encompassing embrace of everything is allowable are the immutable laws set in place which we are constrained to—like time, gravity, and death.

Authoritarianism, like cultural Marxism, is at odds with our founding father's constitution of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which is a God-ordained decree, immutable and self-evident, echoing Martin Luther's famous speech from the Emancipation Proclamation. Like gain of function research and authoritarianism, these are set at odds with their counterpart and are to be resisted with your life.

Evolution demands that fitness be preserved and aimed at physically and spiritually. And so with increasing authoritarianism and draconian legislation aimed at making us happier, to coexist with everything, accept everything, have no boundaries and have no morals—I'll leave you with: have at it or resist and live.

2022 will soon be here, but we will move on. And for those who have ears, let them hear what the spirit says. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all. My name's Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thanks for tuning in tonight.

**Andrew Murray:** Good night.
