## Introduction
*fats, nutrition, dietary-recommendations, science-politics*

**Host:** Welcome to Politics and Science. I'm pleased to have Raymond Peat, endocrinologist and physiologist from Eugene, Oregon. Ray, how are you today?

**Dr. Peat:** Good.

**Host:** Ray, maybe you should give us your background because you can do it better than I can.

## Dr. Peat's Background and Education
*education, biology, graduate-school, academia*

**Dr. Peat:** I was a humanities person first. While I was studying painting and literature, I was interested in science and read widely in libraries and encyclopedias. My first teaching job while studying linguistics at Ohio State was in a small college where I taught biology.

That experience was fun, so I taught art and English for a few years after that. But I finally decided to go back to graduate school in 1968 to study biology. My first university science courses didn't impress me—I felt the institutions were anti-educational, designed to prepare people to conform and get jobs within the system.

By the time I decided to be a biologist, I had learned to be quiet enough to get through the degree program. Most people recognize that graduate school is an exercise in conformism rather than genuine learning.

**Host:** You mean they're looking for certain behavioral patterns from their students?

**Dr. Peat:** In the 1960s, psychologists at Oregon State University studied academic success using the Miller Analogies test—partly cultural knowledge, partly mental flexibility. They found that students scoring average on this test were the most successful in graduate school. Those who deviated either up or down were less successful.

So having average ability and conforming really is the way to be an outstanding graduate student. I got my Ph.D. in 1972, actually taking more courses in biochemistry than in biology, but the degree was in biology.

**Host:** And since then you've taught at a number of universities, I believe.

**Dr. Peat:** I taught at the University of Oregon, and also in Mexico—at the University of Veracruz and State University of Mexico.

## Publishing Outside the System
*publishing, peer-review, scientific-resistance, independence*

**Host:** And you write extensively in Ray Peat's Newsletter.

**Dr. Peat:** I've been doing that since 1981. Essentially all of my research was rejected by journals, so I decided to publish my own work without dealing with editors. I had sent very simple, critical letters to editors—for example, pointing out that Science magazine was drawing racist conclusions from evidence that had nothing to do with those conclusions.

Even a two-sentence criticism like that was rejected as being more extreme than the authors of the study I was commenting on. I considered science to be so political that I decided to publish my own books and newsletters.

**Host:** Some of your writings prompted me to name the show Politics and Science, because the two seem very closely interwoven—unable to escape from each other, to the detriment of science.

## Politics Suppressing Inconvenient Science
*politics-in-science, academic-freedom, radiation, censorship*

**Dr. Peat:** In the 1950s, my biology course was officially named "Biology Introduction for Physics Majors." Since students were planning to major in physics, I thought the course should relate to their interests. I focused on information technology—how the organism was interpreted as information—and radiation biology.

When students got interested in what the government was saying about radioactive fallout safety, it caused turmoil among the university trustees. They invited a professor from University of Illinois to apply for my job. His invited lecture on radiation biology made a point by saying, "Notice I'm not wearing a wristwatch. I realized how much radiation was being emitted from the dial, so I threw my watch away in radioactive disposal."

He not only didn't get the job he applied for, but he got fired from the University of Illinois.

**Host:** I wonder how many candidates they went through before finding a proper replacement for you.

**Dr. Peat:** I never heard.

**Host:** I recommended to you a book called "Cold War in Biology," which certainly speaks to the politics going on with science.

**Dr. Peat:** That's a good introduction to the politics of genetics—not just the racist genetics taught in American universities, but the whole history going back to the 19th century.

## Traditional Fat Consumption and Industrial Substitution
*fats-history, butter, saturated-fats, industrial-oils*

**Host:** I was hoping today we'd talk about fats, since it's a subject that's constantly in the news. The government makes recommendations about what fats you should eat, and they seem to change their minds every five years.

When I was growing up, they told you to avoid greasy fried foods, which I think at that time was vegetable oil. Around the 1960s, they told you those fats were good for you, and the thing to avoid was butter.

**Dr. Peat:** The Wesson oil was cottonseed oil.

**Host:** Was it? I always thought it was corn oil.

**Dr. Peat:** It may have been corn at some point, but in the 1950s when I investigated it, it was cottonseed oil. That oil has a long history. Mark Twain in one of his books mentioned hearing a conversation, I think in the 1860s, about how people planned to make Americans eat cottonseed oil instead of butter.

**Host:** That's right. Talk about a fat conspiracy. I think they were taking olive oil from Italy and cutting it 10 to 1 with cottonseed oil.

**Dr. Peat:** About ten years ago, the FDA surveyed all imported olive oil sold in the US and reported that 70% of it was adulterated.

**Host:** That's not encouraging. Maybe we could start with the history of fat consumption—what's traditionally been eaten by humans and how that's evolved in the last century.

## How Industry Promoted Unsaturated Fats as Essential
*essential-fatty-acids, marketing, linseed-oil, unsaturated-fats*

**Dr. Peat:** In the 19th century, my relatives preferred fat meat to lean meat, and the taste seemed to be an important guide. People didn't trim the fat because it tasted good.

In relatively isolated areas, people used exotic oils like coconut, avocados, and sunflower seeds. Around the 18th century, the industrial market started promoting cod liver oil and seed oils. Fish oil was primarily used for varnish and lamps until petroleum became cheap in the mid-1900s.

Then petroleum products became cheaper than plant and fish oils, and these industries looked for new markets. Coconut oil is easy to extract with primitive technology. In oriental countries, people boiled semi-dried coconut meat and floated off the oil—very cheap, didn't get rancid.

In the US, it fed chickens and pigs and was used to make Oreo cookies. But around the 1940s, the agricultural industry found that coconut oil stimulated animals' appetites and metabolic rates, causing them to eat more and gain less weight. Some reactions included using chemical poisons to suppress metabolic rate by poisoning thyroid glands. Another approach was using unsaturated fats—fish oil, linseed oil, cottonseed oil—to slow metabolism and increase fat gain more cheaply.

Around 1950, petroleum chemists found new uses for petroleum in making paints and plastics. Fish oil and linseed oil had been major sources for paints and varnishes, so those markets were lost. The linseed oil industry looked for new ways to sell products. That's when the idea of unsaturated fats as essential nutrients began being promoted.

The study cited for decades claimed unsaturated fats were essential—performed by the lard industry. The linseed oil industry, with its unsaturated fats, picked up this research. But they ignored studies showing animals thrived on diets completely lacking unsaturated fats. That selective research created the idea that unsaturated fats are essential nutrients.

---

## The Myth of Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency
*essential-fatty-acids, deficiency-disease, vitamin-B6, malnutrition*

**Host:** Even though they claim they're essential, you're saying there were experiments where animals thrived without them?

**Dr. Peat:** Starting around 1910 through the 1920s, several experiments showed animals were actually healthier without any fats. A German study published in 1927 showed that as animals received less fat, cancer incidence decreased—cancer rate was directly proportional to fat in the diet. That study and others showing increased longevity were ignored in research claiming unsaturated fats were essential.

**Host:** You hear that from many people—that they're essential. It's ubiquitous.

**Dr. Peat:** The University of Texas had a famous nutrition lab under Roger Williams, who wrote "Nutrition Against Disease" in the 1950s or 60s. In the 1940s, a rat disease supposedly caused by essential fatty acid deficiency looked exactly like vitamin B6 deficiency disease.

The Texas lab recognized this. B vitamins were only partially identified when the original 1929 research was done, but by the 1940s they had identified the specific B6 deficiency disease. They reproduced the original diet but gave animals vitamin B6, and it completely cured the "essential fatty acid deficiency"—without any essential fatty acids.

The real cause was that unsaturated fatty acids suppress metabolic rate. When metabolism is suppressed, you don't eat as much food or drink as much water, so nutritional requirements are depressed. But if you stimulate metabolism by not giving them suppressive unsaturated fatty acids, you reveal a vitamin deficiency. As metabolic rate increases, you eat more protein and use up vitamin B6 faster.

---

## Misdiagnosed Deficiency Cases
*intravenous-nutrition, zinc, biotin, incomplete-feeding*

**Host:** So people think symptoms caused by vitamin B6 deficiency are from lack of EFAs?

**Dr. Peat:** There were a few other isolated studies through the 1950s and 60s where one patient got eczema and that was published as proof of essential fatty acid deficiency. But when they gave fat-free diets, they often used intravenous feeding. Their concept of complete intravenous nutrition until well into the 1970s was radically deficient in several essential known nutrients.

Zinc, for example, wasn't included. Biotin deficiency can produce related symptoms. When metabolic rate is high and you metabolize more protein, that's when zinc, biotin, and B6 deficiencies show up first—especially with a high metabolic rate but low vitamin sources.

**Host:** So the control group not given essential fatty acids weren't getting minerals and vitamins?

**Dr. Peat:** Yes. Several publications were on intravenous feedings they called "complete nutrition." Hospitals even kept babies on this. Even though nutrition journals knew zinc was essential, hospitals refused to include it because doctors weren't doing it—only nutritionists said humans needed zinc.

**Host:** So it's confusing when people have a symptom like eczema and a naturopath tells them to take flax oil.

**Dr. Peat:** If you suppress your metabolism, you can get below the metabolic rate where you need certain nutrition. You can cure a vitamin B6, biotin, or zinc deficiency sometimes just by taking a toxic thing that suppresses metabolism. But that has other bad effects in the long run.

## Fish Oil, Inflammation, and Immune Suppression
*fish-oil, inflammation, immunity, oxidative-products*

**Host:** Fish oil is used to suppress inflammation. What's your take on that?

**Dr. Peat:** Fish oil has powerful effects on suppressing immunity. David Horaban, for example, went on advocating polyunsaturated fats therapeutically even though he published evidence showing decisive suppression of the immune system. You can get away with suppressing inflammation by knocking out your immune system for six months or a year, maybe a couple of years. But it's not good in the long run.

**Host:** I know some people take fish oil to fight depression. What's your take on that?

**Dr. Peat:** I've read all the publications on it. Some say it makes depression worse, some say it does nothing. If you select the few that say it helped a certain group, you can truthfully report that improvement. But someone else reports their group got worse on fish oil.

If there's bias in which studies get published, you see empirical data that exists in the world but not in the medical literature.

**Host:** I read a quote from a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, from one of your newsletters.

**Dr. Peat:** If you have a probability at the 5% level but reject 10, 20, or 100 publications with negative results, you're biasing statistics.

## Canola, Rapeseed, and the Ratio of Fats
*canola-oil, linoleic-acid, fatty-acid-ratio, heart-disease*

**Host:** Maybe we should cover the different fats. People want to know what's bad and what's good. Is canola as bad as cottonseed oil?

**Dr. Peat:** In the 1960s, there was concern about a special toxic fat in mustard oil and rapeseed oil. They bred a variety without that fatty acid—that became canola. But researcher Hans Selye showed that giving rapeseed oil caused spots of heart tissue to die.

Mainstream medicine said that was because of the toxic fatty acid being eliminated. But Selye gave purified linoleic acid—a major component of rapeseed oil—and showed that was the actual toxic agent to the heart, not the so-called special toxic fatty acid. Adding cocoa butter to the diet protected the heart, even with the same amount of linoleic acid. Adding stearic acid was protective.

**Host:** So it's the ratio that's important?

**Dr. Peat:** One early rat study that got me interested in coconut oil put different groups on pure coconut oil (high, medium, low fat) or pure unsaturated corn oil (high, medium, low). They stayed on these diets throughout their lifespan. At the end of their normal lifespan, fat rats were those on unsaturated fat diet. Lean rats were on saturated fat diet.

The quantity of fat didn't make significant difference. It was the ratio. The degree of unsaturation corresponded directly to the degree of obesity. So high fat versus low fat isn't the issue—it's the unsaturation that's the problem.

## Unsaturated Fats and Thyroid Function
*thyroid-function, unsaturated-fats, metabolism, hormonal-effects*

**Dr. Peat:** French publications in the 1980s defined biochemically what pig farmers demonstrated practically. They used specific fatty acids on animals and examined effects on thyroid system components.

They showed that increasing unsaturations made things progressively worse: monounsaturated was bad, two double bonds was worse, three was worse, and multiply unsaturated was worst. Every component of the thyroid system—hormone secretion, transport, and cellular response—was selectively inhibited in proportion to the unsaturation of the oil.

This neatly explained what pig farmers found: by slowing the pig's metabolic rate with unsaturated fat diet, it would gain weight more cheaply.

**Host:** The thyroid is probably worth a whole show, but could you summarize what the thyroid does?

**Dr. Peat:** The real active part of thyroid hormone wasn't discovered until the 1950s, but its function was studied since the late 1800s. It was known to activate all organs—to make them consume more oxygen and perform more perfectly.

Thyroid deficiency early in life causes mental retardation, brain underdevelopment, even idiocy. If it develops later, it causes infertility. In some areas of the world, cretins—people with severe thyroid deficiency—were considered good employees because they were passive, stupid, and didn't reproduce. The medical establishment in those areas didn't want to cure it because they were good for herding sheep and such chores.

## Iodine Deficiency and Regional Disease Patterns
*iodine-deficiency, goiter, heart-disease, thyroid*

**Host:** You're describing a form of eugenics?

**Dr. Peat:** Broda Barnes in the 1930s studied both rabbits and Europeans and found that goiter belts were highly susceptible to heart disease at very young ages—starting in their 30s with atherosclerosis and heart attacks. When iodine was introduced to those regions, heart disease mortality decreased considerably.

But those areas also had very high cancer rates, especially breast cancer. As recently as the 1980s, cancer biologists in Mexico reported that iodine deficiency regions in mountains around Mexico City still had very high rates of tuberculosis, heart disease, and breast cancer—all things Broda Barnes noticed in Eastern Europe in the 1930s.

**Host:** Iodine deficiency slows thyroid function?

**Dr. Peat:** In some regions, iodine deficiency resulted from specific foods or contaminants. In many areas, diet interacts with limited iodine so it's not just iodine deficiency, but eating vegetables that interrupt thyroid hormone formation.

The cabbage family and unsaturated fats are the two most famous causes of interrupting thyroid hormone formation. The pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) that compensates when thyroid is being blocked.

Estrogen naturally inhibits thyroid release too. The body is designed so if estrogen inhibits the gland, TSH increases to overcome that block and activates the thyroid to work harder. If you keep estrogen or goitrogen high, TSH works harder and harder, the gland gets bigger and bigger—sometimes as big as a cantaloupe.

Women at puberty and during pregnancy often get fullness in the neck, causing creases in the skin above and below where the thyroid is. The thyroid gland is at the base of the neck on both sides of the windpipe. Most women, but almost no men, have a defining crease right above the collarbone.

**Host:** That crease is from low thyroid?

**Dr. Peat:** At puberty, the thyroid naturally enlarges to overcome estrogen's effect, creating fullness so neck bending causes creases that outline the puffy area where the thyroid lives.

**Host:** Is that something completely normal?

**Dr. Peat:** That's part of what makes women look attractive because it corresponds to years between puberty and menopause.

## Ubiquity of Unsaturated Fats and Impossible Deficiency
*essential-fatty-acids, ubiquity, marketing, deficiency-impossible*

**Host:** You've said calling unsaturated fats essential is ridiculous because they're everywhere—in every green vegetable. How could we have a deficiency?

**Dr. Peat:** It's a marketing question—the idea that you could be deficient in something in every organism, even tropical organisms. Coconuts have about 1-3% of these fats. Ruminants like sheep, cows, and deer have a rumen organ with bacteria that detoxify these plant fats.

Still, 1-2% of the fats get through the detoxification system. So beef fat and lamb fat unavoidably have about 2% of these unsaturated vegetable oils. Even if you ate nothing but beef, lamb, and coconut, you'd still have more than anyone ever claimed essentiality required.

By the most extreme ideas of essentiality, it's impossible—unless you eat laboratory-prepared food—to have a deficiency. But marketing departments of linseed oil companies convinced people that since it's essential in trace amounts, it must be much better in very large amounts.

But recent research demonstrates that as you increase unsaturated fats in diet, cancer incidence goes up proportionally. When you extrapolate to zero unsaturated fats, cancer incidence approaches zero—just like the 1927 study.

**Host:** When you say extrapolate to zero, you mean no unsaturated fats?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah.

**Host:** Fish oil is marketed heavily as a supplement, not just for depression.

**Dr. Peat:** A few years ago, the FDA warned that total shouldn't exceed 3 grams of DHA and EPA. More recently they dropped that warning and began promoting it without caution.

It definitely becomes toxic, as immune suppression studies demonstrated. The odd thing is fish oil is so unstable—it was a good varnish because it oxidizes almost instantly at room temperature. In your body, it's mostly oxidized before reaching bloodstream.

It passes through your digestive system, getting heated and circulated in tiny particles exposed to oxygen. Those "beneficial anti-inflammatory effects" are actually produced by oxidative breakdown products of the fats. Even biochemically, it's a toxic effect being sold as a benefit.

**Host:** So it's suppressing your immune system, and that's getting rid of some symptoms?

**Dr. Peat:** Yes. It's the free radical oxidative decomposition products circulating in your blood. A very small part reaches your tissues as original DHA and EPA.

## Industry Capture of Science and Health Policy
*industry-influence, research-bias, fish-oil-industry, regulatory-capture*

**Host:** We should mention you're talking to Dr. Raymond Peat. We're discussing fats today, but also the marketing of them and scientific research. How much does marketing affect the scientific research? The media still promotes unsaturated fats.

**Dr. Peat:** The industry apparently has taken over government. I see the government has basic fish oil promotion on their website.

**Host:** Is that the FDA?

**Dr. Peat:** The industry, like the soy oil industry, subsidized research on soy oil's health value. The fish oil industry is now rich enough to sponsor conferences, pay researchers to produce studies, and get people on editorial boards of journals—just like the atomic energy industry controlled research on radiation safety.

The health effects of fats are being promoted by industry, not by objective science.

**Host:** You mentioned cancer with unsaturated oils. Does that apply to fish oil too?

**Dr. Peat:** The shorter 18-carbon oils from seeds fit into our enzyme systems more powerfully and inhibit our own enzymes more. Fish oils are very long and don't directly attack our enzymes the same way. They're unstable and spontaneously turn into free radical and aldehyde toxins.

But they're safer to our enzyme systems because their carbon number is very different from fats we make or get from seeds.

**Host:** Fish oil comes with vitamins too?

**Dr. Peat:** When you squeeze an oily fish, you can't help getting vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin D, and some E. The E is destroyed quickly by oxidative process, but K comes through strongly because it's harder to oxidize. K and A usually have enough activity to be of some benefit when you eat the fish oil.

## Practical Fat Recommendations
*dietary-recommendations, butter, coconut-oil, safe-fats*

**Host:** We have about five minutes left. What would you think is good to eat? Is olive oil okay? Coconut oil? Margarine?

**Dr. Peat:** Coconut oil is around 10% polyunsaturated fats. If you use half a teaspoon for flavoring or a teaspoon every other day, that's small enough to not be harmful as minor flavoring. Olive oil is fine.

But as a major part of diet, I think butter, beef fat, lamb fat, and coconut oil are the safe ones. Also cocoa butter chocolate and some studies found longer saturated fats are very protective—being investigated for curing cancer and heart disease.

Some of the best studies use long chain saturated fats and ordinary butter fats for treating liver disease. Alcoholic hepatitis is being successfully treated with saturated fat because about 20 years ago they noticed that alcoholic liver injury requires polyunsaturated fats in the diet.

Some realized in areas of India where they eat primarily butter, alcoholics don't get liver disease at the high rate they do in areas eating unsaturated fats. Animal studies led to human studies in Chicago finding actual cures of alcoholic liver disease with good diet plus saturated fats.

**Host:** Are those ongoing studies now or older?

**Dr. Peat:** I haven't seen anything new in the last year or two.

**Host:** When you say long chain, is that coconut oil?

**Dr. Peat:** Coconut goes up to 16 carbons. Butter is 18 carbons. They're experimenting with some derived from sugar cane wax and other unusual long chain fats, but those are being used therapeutically in cancer too.

## Navigating Ubiquitous Unsaturated Oils
*dietary-strategy, restaurant-food, processed-food, consumer-demand*

**Host:** Unsaturated oils are in everything now because the government sanctioned them. You can't buy a potato chip that isn't cooked in canola or some vegetable oil. If you go out to dinner, what can you do to protect yourself?

**Dr. Peat:** About 15 years ago there was a campaign to get coconut oil off the market. In recent years it's coming back. If people nag cooks in restaurants and buyers in grocery stores, they can change things. It's already changing back in recent years—people demanding real butter and other saturated fats.

---

## Saturated Fats and Body Weight
*weight-gain, polyunsaturated-fats, body-composition, dairy-foods*

**Host:** Finally, most people worry about getting fat when you say butter, even though we love it.

**Dr. Peat:** Animal studies from industrial agriculture to lab studies show polyunsaturated fats are extremely fattening in proportion to their role in diet. The ratio to saturated fats is more important than actual quantity of fats.

In Finland, dairy foods are probably the most common food. Just going across the border from Russia to Finland, you go from a starch-eating vegetable-based diet where everyone's fat to a lean, healthy population eating lots of butterfat. Americans who eat milk and milk products are lean, and it's partly the calcium and vitamin D, but also the butter fat itself is helpful.

**Host:** That's the French paradox again—how come the French are so healthy when they eat all that nasty saturated fat?

**Dr. Peat:** Yes.

---

## Skin Health and Conclusion
*skin-health, sun-damage, saturated-fats, oxidation*

**Host:** Ray, is there anything else you'd like to add?

**Dr. Peat:** People are concerned about skin health and appearance. An experiment with rabbits is interesting. Rabbits on either corn oil or coconut oil diet were shaved so sun would hit their skin. Those on unsaturated corn oil diet got wrinkly, sun-damaged skin. Those on saturated fat diet had relatively harmless sun exposure to their skin.

**Host:** That's quite telling. Well Ray, thanks so much for being on today. The hour flew by.

**Dr. Peat:** Thank you.

**Host:** I'll give out your website information for people.

**Dr. Peat:** Very good.
